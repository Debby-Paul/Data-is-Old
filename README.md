# Data-is-Old
This is my first repo as a Data Analyst. Practice files will be saved here for reference
My major interest as a data analyst is Education (from Local to Global level) and everything Tech roles (from Local to Global level)
  **Education**: I want to know the level at which people are learning and discovering new things, how students are transitioning, adopting, and utilizing  emerging technologies and the level to which this transitioning, adopting, and using is happening. I want to know the challenges students and teachers face while utilizing certain techs in their schools etc.
  **Everything Tech roles**: My interest in tech is making me very curious to know how the health of tech roles are from 2020 to whatever year we are in. How many people were employed as data analyst in 2020 and how many people are this year? Which tech role has more people and why? which tech role has fewer people and why?
Stay tuned, while I serve you premium.
